## Blogging Site Mini Project Requirement

## Phase I

### Models
- Author Model
```
{ fname: { mandatory}, lname: {mandatory}, title: {mandatory, enum[Mr, Mrs, Miss]}, email: {mandatory, valid email, unique}, password: {mandatory} }
```
- Blogs Model
```
{ title: {mandatory}, body: {mandatory}, authorId: {mandatory, refs to author model}, tags: {array of string}, category: {string, mandatory, examples: [technology, entertainment, life style, food, fashion]}, subcategory: {array of string, examples[technology-[web development, mobile development, AI, ML etc]] }, createdAt, updatedAt, deletedAt: {when the document is deleted}, isDeleted: {boolean, default: false}, publishedAt: {when the blog is published}, isPublished: {boolean, default: false}}
```

### Author APIs /authors
- Create an author - atleast 5 authors
- Create a author document from request body.
  `Endpoint: BASE_URL/authors`

### POST /blogs
- Create a blog document from request body. Get authorId in request body only.
- Make sure the authorId is a valid authorId by checking the author exist in the authors collection.
- Return HTTP status 201 on a succesful blog creation. Also return the blog document. The response should be a JSON object like [this](#successful-response-structure) 
- Create atleast 5 blogs for each author

- Return HTTP status 400 for an invalid request with a response body like [this](#error-response-structure)

### GET /blogs
- Returns all blogs in the collection that aren't deleted and are published
- Return the HTTP status 200 if any documents are found. The response structure should be like [this](#successful-response-structure) 
- If no documents are found then return an HTTP status 404 with a response like [this](#error-response-structure) 
- Filter blogs list by applying filters. Query param can have any combination of below filters.
  - By author Id
  - By category
  - List of blogs that have a specific tag
  - List of blogs that have a specific subcategory
example of a query url: blogs?filtername=filtervalue&f2=fv2

### PUT /blogs/:blogId
- Updates a blog by changing the its title, body, adding tags, adding a subcategory. (Assuming tag and subcategory received in body is need to be added)
- Updates a blog by changing its publish status i.e. adds publishedAt date and set published to true
- Check if the blogId exists (must have isDeleted false). If it doesn't, return an HTTP status 404 with a response body like [this](#error-response-structure)
- Return an HTTP status 200 if updated successfully with a body like [this](#successful-response-structure) 
- Also make sure in the response you return the updated blog document. 

### DELETE /blogs/:blogId
- Check if the blogId exists( and is not deleted). If it does, mark it deleted and return an HTTP status 200 without any response body.
- If the blog document doesn't exist then return an HTTP status of 404 with a body like [this](#error-response-structure) 

### DELETE /blogs?queryParams
- Delete blog documents by category, authorid, tag name, subcategory name, unpublished
- If the blog document doesn't exist then return an HTTP status of 404 with a body like [this](#error-response-structure)

## Phase II

- Add authentication and authroisation feature

### POST /login
- Allow an author to login with their email and password. On a successful login attempt return a JWT token contatining the authorId
- If the credentials are incorrect return a suitable error message with a valid HTTP status code

### Authentication
- Add an authorisation implementation for the JWT token that validates the token before every protected endpoint is called. If the validation fails, return a suitable error message with a corresponding HTTP status code
- Protected routes are create a blog, edit a blog, get the list of blogs, delete a blog(s)
- Set the token, once validated, in the request - `x-api-key`
- Use a middleware for authentication purpose.

### Authorisation
- Make sure that only the owner of the blogs is able to edit or delete the blog.
- In case of unauthorized access return an appropirate error message.

## Testing 
- To test these apis create a new collection in Postman named Project 1 Blogging 
- Each api should have a new request in this collection
- Each request in the collection should be rightly named. Eg Create author, Create blog, Get blogs etc
- Each member of each team should have their tests in running state


Refer below sample

 ![A Postman collection and request sample](assets/Postman-collection-sample.png)

## Response

### Successful Response structure
```yaml
{
  status: true,
  data: {

  }
}
```
### Error Response structure
```yaml
{
  status: false,
  msg: ""
}
```





## Collections
### Blogs
```yaml
{
  "title": "How to win friends",
  "body": "Blog body",
  "tags": ["Book", "Friends", "Self help"],
  "category": "Book",
  "subcategory": ["Non fiction", "Self Help"],
  "published": false,
  "publishedAt": "", // if published is true publishedAt will have a date 2021-09-17T04:25:07.803Z
  "deleted": false,
  "deletedAt": "", // if deleted is true deletedAt will have a date 2021-09-17T04:25:07.803Z,
  "createdAt": "2021-09-17T04:25:07.803Z",
  "updatedAt": "2021-09-17T04:25:07.803Z",
}
```

#### Note: Create a group database and use the same database in connection string by replacing `groupXDatabase`






// COMMON MISTAKES IN FS and BUILDING GITHUB DOWNLOAD URL:
// aapne apne branch me nahi dekh rhe ho- You are not looking up in your own branch
// Your file address might not be accurate- it might have extra / or . etc 
//  you have not uploaded on github yet
// your folder structure is not relative to the position from which you are running your code..check the folder from which you have started your program
// Your folder is not created yet

# Problem Statements

**Note: ** : Each person should submit 2 branches - W7D1/<name> and W7D5/<name>

## Problem 1

- Cut your branch from session/fs : W7D1/<name>
- An api to write a file at root
- An api to write a file at a specific directory : src/<yourname>/
- Refer [this](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v15.x/api/fs.html)

## Problem 2
  
- From the book-management solution of your group, cut a branch of your own : W7D5/<name>
- Allow the create book api to accept a multi-part request body
- Add a field ‘bookCover' in the book schema that saves the relative path of the book cover image
- For example for the book ‘Midnight’s Children’, the ‘bookCover' field could have a value like ’src/assets/bookcovers/midights-children.jpeg’
- For the fetch book api, write logic that sends a proper link for the bookcover in response body against the field ‘bookCover’. Don’t directly send back the relative path saved in the db
- A proper link means a download_url for a Github file. For example a url that shows you the content of a file instead of a GitHub url for the file
  
 ### A content_url looks like this
   ![A html ulr is rendered on the browser like this](html_url.png)
  
 ### A download_url looks like this
